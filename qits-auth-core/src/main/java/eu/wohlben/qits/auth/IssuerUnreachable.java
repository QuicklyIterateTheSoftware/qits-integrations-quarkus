/**
 * Answers 503 when a request could not be authenticated because qits-idp was unreachable.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> quarkus-oidc initializes its tenant lazily — on the first request that
 * presents a credential — and if the issuer cannot be reached at that moment it throws {@code
 * OIDCException}. Nothing maps that, so it reaches Quarkus' own error handler and becomes a
 * <b>500</b> with an error id. A 500 tells a caller its request was wrong; the request was fine and
 * the platform was briefly unable to check a token. Callers act on that difference: the announcement
 * paths between qits-ci and qits-platform-deployments are fire-and-forget and swallow failures at
 * debug, so a 500 there is a deployment that silently never happens.
 *
 * <p><b>Only connectivity counts.</b> {@code OIDCException} also covers configuration mistakes — a
 * wrong audience, an unparseable key — and those are genuinely this service's fault and stay 500. So
 * the chain has to show BOTH an OIDC failure AND a connectivity cause before this answers 503.
 * Retrying a misconfiguration would just move the failure to the caller's patience.
 *
 * <p><b>Matched by name, not by type,</b> and that is deliberate: {@code quarkus-oidc} is not a
 * dependency of this library. Services that only take the forward-auth half of it do not carry the
 * extension, and adding it here to reference one exception class would put an issuer client on
 * their classpath to satisfy an import. The name is API — it is what a caller reads in a log line.
 *
 * <p>This handles the window that {@code quarkus.oidc.connection-delay} does not: that key retries
 * the connection while the process is STARTING, so it covers a cold boot racing idp. An idp that
 * goes away later is this class's case.
